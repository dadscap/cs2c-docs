These fields are specific to the portfolio system.

| Field | Type | Description |
| ----- | ---- | ----------- |
| portfolio_id | uuid | Unique ID for the portfolio. |
| source | string | Where the portfolio entry came from. One of: `manual`, `steam`, `csv`. |
| steam_assetid | string | Original Steam asset ID for items imported from a Steam inventory. |

## Item Identity

These fields identify an item and appear in most responses across the API.

| Field | Type | Description |
| ----- | ---- | ----------- |
| item_id | integer | Internal catalog ID assigned by this API. It stays stable across providers. Prefer this over `market_hash_name` once you have resolved it. |
| market_hash_name | string | Canonical Steam market hash name, for example `★ Gut Knife \| Fade (Factory New)`. Use this when you do not have an `item_id` yet. |
| phase | string | Doppler or Gamma Doppler variant label, for example `Phase 1` or `Emerald`. This is `null` when phase is not relevant to the item. |
| provider | string | Provider key used by this API, for example `steam`, `buff163`, or `csfloat`. Use provider keys in request parameters, not brand names. |

---

## Price Fields

All price fields are returned in **minor units** of the response currency. Divide by 100 for display.

For example, `lowest_ask = 2550` with `currency = USD` means **$25.50**.

| Field | Type | Endpoint | Description |
| ----- | ---- | -------- | ----------- |
| lowest_ask | integer | `/prices` | Current best ask price across listed offers. |
| highest_bid | integer | `/bids` | Current best buy order price. |
| price | integer | `/sales` | Completed sale price. |
| best_ask | integer | `/portfolio/value` | Lowest ask across all queried providers for the item. |
| item_value | integer | `/portfolio/value` | `best_ask × quantity`. |
| total_value | integer | `/portfolio/value` | Sum of all `item_value` amounts in the response. |

---

## Sale Fields

| Field | Type | Description |
| ----- | ---- | ----------- |
| quantity | integer | Number of units in the listing. Returned by `/prices`. |
| num_bids | integer | Number of active buy orders at the reported `highest_bid` price level. |
| date | datetime | ISO 8601 UTC timestamp for when the sale happened on the provider marketplace. Returned by `/sales`. |
| currency | string | ISO 4217 currency code used by the values in the record, for example `USD`. |

---

## Timestamp Fields

| Field | Type | Description |
| ----- | ---- | ----------- |
| timestamp | datetime | Time when the current `price` and `quantity` combination was observed for a provider. |
| last_updated | datetime | ISO 8601 UTC timestamp for when this system last ingested or processed the record. This is different from `timestamp`, which reflects the provider-side observation time. |
| date | datetime | ISO 8601 UTC timestamp for the sale event time reported by the provider. Returned by `/sales`. |

---

## Link Fields

| Field | Type | Tier | Description |
| ----- | ---- | ---- | ----------- |
| link | string | All tiers | Tracked redirect URL through this API's domain (`/r/:provider/:item_id`). It resolves to the marketplace listing and may include affiliate or referral tracking. |
| url | string | `pro` `quant` | Direct marketplace URL with no API-domain redirect. |

## Pagination

List endpoints return a `pagination` object alongside `items`.

| Field | Type | Description |
| ----- | ---- | ----------- |
| limit | integer | Number of items returned per page. |
| offset | integer | Zero-based starting position for offset-based endpoints. |
| total | integer | Total number of matching items. Returns `-1` on cursor-based endpoints where counting is skipped for performance. |
| has_next | boolean | Whether more items exist after the current page. |
| has_prev | boolean | Whether items exist before the current page. |
| next_cursor | string | Cursor string for cursor-based endpoints. Pass it back as the `cursor` parameter to get the next page. `null` means there are no more pages. |

---

## Response Envelope

Most list endpoints return these top-level fields:

| Field | Type | Description |
| ----- | ---- | ----------- |
| items | array | Main data payload. |
| pagination | object | Pagination metadata. See [Pagination](#pagination). |
| meta | object | Response context such as currency, filters, and returned providers. |
| meta.currency | string | ISO 4217 currency code that all price values in the response use. |
| meta.returned_providers | array[string] | Provider keys that returned data in this response. This can be a subset of what was requested. |
| meta.filters | object | Echo of the effective filters applied to the request, including `market_hash_name`, `phase`, and `requested_providers`. |

---

## Item Catalog Fields

These fields are returned by `/items`. All are nullable. A `null` value means the field is either not applicable to that item or not known.

| Field | Type | Description |
